1. Subject
============
    What is Subject?

    A Subject is a sort of bridge or proxy that is available in some implementations of ReactiveX
    that acts both as an observer and as an Observable.
    Because it is an observer, it can subscribe to one or more Observables,
     and because it is an Observable, it can pass through the items it observes by re-emitting them, and it can also emit new items.


Consumer Interface
===================
It is a simple java interface that accepts vatiable of type T. and as you said it is used for callbacks.

Why does it work? How can we use a Consumer instead of an Observer?

RxJava simply creates an Observer, passes the Consumer to it an it gets called in onNext

CompositeDisposable
======================
The Single class and other observable classes offer different subscribe methods, which return a Disposable object

When working with multiple subscriptions,
which may become obsolete due to the same state change using a CompositeDisposable is
pretty handy to dispose a collection of subscriptions.
